# Simple AngularJS Contacts app

## Simple SPA using uiRouter

# Folders
./libs/ - The required libraries for the app.
./src - where the simple code of the application is, just an example, I know it could be structured way better, it's not a complex project though :)

# Instructions
run `bower install` from the project root, then cd into src and run a simple http-server

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer` or `http-server` (the last one should be installed as a global npm package)

Navigate to localhost and that's it.
